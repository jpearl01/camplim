# Validators module for Meteor Astronomy

The validators module introduces a nice way of checking fields values' validity. For instance, we can check whether the given field's value is an email string or matches a regular expression. You can also write your own validators. You can add it to your Meteor project using the following command.

A detailed information about module can be found [here](http://astronomy.jagi.io/#validators).
